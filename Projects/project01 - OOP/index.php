    Project is client-deliverable although a bit spartan.  

validation of fields needs to be next to the field itself.

validation does not preclude special characters or numbers.  Need to list madlbs from newest to oldest.

ï»¿folder structure should include the following:  css, js, images, etc..  Javascript validation function exists,but is not used. 

missing sql for project for me to recreate db.

madlibs should be in the opposite order as you have them.  

index does a ton of the heavy lifting here.  You have a nice object-oriented structure in places.
